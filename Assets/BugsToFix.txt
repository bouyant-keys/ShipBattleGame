Bugs in no particular order
- Bullets will sometimes not riccochet when they should
- Bullets will collide with destroyed tanks
- Bullet pop particle will move instead of staying still
- Mines placed by enemies will default to the same position except when about to explode
    - Probably mesh is just offset?
- Mines do not flash before exploding
- GameManager upon reloading or starting a new level will not progress into the intro sequence
    - Previous solution was moving the starting function from the playercontroller into GameManager
    But that doesn't seem to work for any other scenes except the one you press play in.

General Things:
- Add a tutorial screen! Or integrate it into the first couple levels!
    - Add ui info for bullets and mines, how many there are - are in use- and when you've run out
- Replace all stationary tanks with the new StationaryEnemyTank prefab
- Update all Scene models (e.g. Water, Crates, bouys, etc.)
- On maximized, the top of text have some kind of text fragment?
- Generally improve the look of particle effects, as they don't match the game style
- Make it so crates (breakable blocks) aren't scaled in any scenes
- shadows for the ships aren't completely solid


*** Possible Additions:
- Fisheye lens effect on camera, to make ships look like toys
- More levels? up to lvl 15 instead of 10?
- Final Boss level
    - Stronger tank that takes multiple hits, is bigger, has the crown
    - Upon defeat a star could be added to the main menu, along with your ship now having the crown in game!
- Intro menu could have a slider showing how far to the end you've gotten
- Little white flags bouys to show where enemies were defeated
- destroyed enemies could bounce out of the playable area?
